Modifiying timestamp of a file : ```touch -d "30 days ago" file```

```
find /archive/photos -type d | while read a ; do touch -d "52 days ago" $a/photo2.jpg ; done
```

df /var and du -sh /var/* do not report same size. Some files are deleted but still used by a process.

```
lsof +aL1 /var | grep deleted

ll /proc/pid/fd

echo > /proc/pid/fd/fd_number
```
